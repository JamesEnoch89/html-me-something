<h2>Three ways to Hike the Zion Narrows:</h2>

<div>

	<p><h3>Zion Narrows "Bottom Up" Day Hike:</h3></p>
		<p>For tourists or casual hikers who want to see the best of the Zion Narrows, this is the hike that you want to do!<br> Starting at the Temple of Sinawava, you can hike up the Riverside Walk trail,<br> and then continue hiking right up the river to see some of the best "narrows" sections of the North Fork of the Virgin River.<br> Hike up as far as you want to go and then turn around and retrace your steps.<br> A side hike up Orderville Canyon is also a good detour to see even more amazing slot canyon scenery.<br> As a round-trip hike, this can be as leisurely or strenuous as you wish to make it.<br> <strong> <p class="permit">A wilderness permit is NOT required for this hike.</strong></p></p>

	<p><h3>"Top Down" Two-Day Backpacking</h3></p>
		<p>The "Top Down" Zion Narrows hike is a strenuous 16-mile through hike that starts at Chamberlain's Ranch.<br> (You must drive to or hire a private outfitter to shuttle you to the remote trailhead.) <br>This route takes you through the more subtle scenery of the upper plateau. <br>As you follow the North Fork as it slowly transforms from an open stream into the majestic and deep slot canyon that opens into Zion Canyon.<br> <strong> <p class="permit">A wilderness permit IS required for this route.</strong></p></p>

	<p><h3>"Top Down" Streneuous Day Hike:</h3></p>
		<p>If you are a fast and strong hiker, the "top down" Narrows hike can be completed in one day. <br>This hike may take roughly 12-14 hours to complete, so be sure to start early and keep a good pace! <br>Bring a headlamp just in case you have to hike the last stretch after dark. <br><strong> <p class="permit">A wilderness permit IS required for this route.</strong></p></p>
