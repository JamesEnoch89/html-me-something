<h3>Three ways to Hike the Zion Narrows:</h3>

<ul>

	<li><h2>Zion Narrows "Bottom Up" Day Hike:</h2></li>
		<p>For tourists or casual hikers who want to see the best of the Zion Narrows, this is the hike that you want to do! Starting at the Temple of Sinawava (the last stop on the free Zion Canyon shuttle), you can hike up the Riverside Walk trail and then continue hiking right up the river to see some of the best "narrows" sections of the North Fork of the Virgin River. Hike up as far as you want to go and then turn around and retrace your steps. A side hike up Orderville Canyon is also a good detour to see even more amazing slot canyon scenery. As a round-trip hike, this can be as leisurely or strenuous as you wish to make it. A wilderness permit is NOT required for this hike.</p>

	<li><h2>"Top Down" Two-Day Backpacking</h2></li>
		<p>The "Top Down" Zion Narrows hike is a strenuous 16-mile through hike that starts at Chamberlain's Ranch, many miles northeast of Zion's popular main canyon. (You must drive to or hire a private outfitter to shuttle you to the remote trailhead.) This route takes you through the more subtle scenery of the upper plateau as you follow the North Fork as it slowly transforms from an open stream into the majestic and deep slot canyon that opens into Zion Canyon. A wilderness permit is required for this route and you choose one of the beautiful designated campsites when you purchase your permit at the Visitor Center.</p>

	<li><h2>"Top Down" Streneuous Day Hike:</h2></li>
		<p>If you are a fast and strong hiker, the "top down" Narrows hike can be completed in one day. This hike may take roughly 12-14 hours to complete, so be sure to start early and keep a good pace! Bring a headlamp just in case you have to hike the last stretch after dark. A wilderness permit is required for the top-down day hike.</p>
